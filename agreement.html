        <h3>Section 1 – The sale
        </h3>
        <h4>1 § How it works
        </h4>
        <p>The collaboration model is based on The social vault connecting Creators and helps them sell, via The social
            vault, to external customers, a package (The bundle) consisting of several different creators' products
            which, due to the collective marketing and the cost-efficient nature of digital products, can be sold at a
            discounted price.
        </p>
        <p>The sale towards the customer is made by The social vault, who handles all transactions towards the customer,
            via the website provided by us. The Creator or Affiliate receives a personal and unique URL that they use to
            promote and sell the bundle on their social media.
        </p>
        <p>For each sale made via the Creator's or Affiliate’s personal link, he receives a commission.
        </p>

        <h4>For each sale made via the Creator's or Affiliate’s personal link, he receives a commission.
        </h4>
        <p>The Social Vault AB pays Affiliates and Creators via PayPal or bank transfer.
        </p>
        <p>The Affiliate or Creator is responsible to notify The social vault if any email, bank or similar that may
            affect payment changes.
        </p>
        <p>All fees are exclusive of all taxes, charges, levies, assessments and other fees of any kind imposed on your
            involvement in this Agreement and shall be the responsibility of, and payable by you.
        </p>

        <h4>3 § Order fulfillment and terms of sale</h4>
        <p>The Social Vault will be solely responsible for processing every order placed by a customer via affiliate
            links. Creators and Affiliates are not allowed to regulate the terms of the sale between consumer and The
            social vault, if not stated otherwise in this agreement or by permission of The social vault. The social
            vault will always determine the price paid by the customer.
        </p>

        <h4>4 § Commissions</h4>
        <p>In order for an Affiliate or Creator to earn a commission, a customer must accurately complete the order form
            and submit payment for the product using the secure order system.
        </p>
        <p>Affiliates or Creators are responsible for the URL working properly. This regards, but not exhaustively,
            coding, structure and publishing in such way the links works properly and appropriate for this agreement.
        </p>
        <p>Any errors or inaccuracies in the link creation process may result in the inability to generate commissions
            for the Affiliate.
        </p>
        <p>For the purpose of this agreement Sale means transaction whereby a customer:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>uses a link to enter our sales page;
            </li>
            <li>purchases one item; and
            </li>
            <li>remits full payment to The Social Vault
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>In case of a refund, cancellation or similar by the customer towards The social vault, resulting in a lost
            sale for The social vault, the criteria of “full payment” in 3. is not met.
        </p>
        <p>Only URL where your sales and clicks will be tracked count as valid sales. If a customer initially visits the
            site using a link, any transaction completed by that customer on the site, whether or not via his or her
            link, will count as long as it was completed in the same device and browser and the customer did not use a
            different URL. A sale that happens without a URL or is however not counted as a valid commission-eligible
            sale according to this agreement.
        </p>
        <p>Creators will receive 70% and Affiliates will receive 40% of net profits (profit left after deduction of
            transaction costs and gateway fees) of what sale they generate via their unique affiliate link.
        </p>

        <h4>5 § About the launch</h4>
        <p>The preliminary launch date is November 2023 but may be changed by The social vault. In case of a relaunch or
            similar were to occur during the period in 2 section 4 §, you will be asked to participate. The Creator has
            in that case the right to not include his product, and an Affiliate has no obligation to participate.

            indirectly, and whether it is initiated by the affiliate or by a third party. </p>
        <p>Before the launch of the wealthy woman bundle, and 12 months after, you agree not to directly or indirectly
            solicit, enter partnership, other bundle collaborations and/or similar business activities with creators and
            affiliates signed to The bundle, without written consent from The Social Vault. </p>
